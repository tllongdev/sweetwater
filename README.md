## What I built

We'd like you to build a Shopping Cart application using Vue.js, Vuex, and ES6. We've provided a JSON file with item data, but you're responsible for building the Cart. Your shopping cart should:

- display the list of items in the cart along with their relevant information; √
- allow item quantities to be changed; √
- display the subtotal for all the items in the cart. √

## How I build it

- You can use any VCS platform you like — such as Gitlab or Github — as long as your project is publicly accessible. √
- Build your shopping cart so we can test it in-browser. √
- Write your application using Vue.js. √
- Manage your data using a Vuex data store. √
- Use the data provided in [items.json](items.json) to populate the cart. Don't make any changes to the data. √
- It's OK to use a CSS framework (like Bootstrap). This isn't a CSS test. It doesn't have to be pretty. √
- Don't use any other JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery. √
- Once you're done, send us the link to your project so we can look it over. √

## Requirements

- **Commit often.** We want to see your progress throughout the project. √
- **Work quickly.** We will be looking at how far you get in the first hour as well as how long it takes you to arrive at a finished product. This project was designed to be completed quickly, so don't spend more than a few hours on it. √
- **Write your own code.** While we understand that there are NPM pakages out there that take care of common problems, we ultimately want to see what _YOU_ can build, not what someone else has built. √
- **Do your best work.** We're using this project as a viewport into who you are as a developer. Show us what you can do! √

## Bonus points

- +10 points for making the data changes persistent. No... we're not going to give you any hints about how we want to see that done. √ √ √
- +10 points if you include the functionality to remove items from the cart. √ √ √
